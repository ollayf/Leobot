and the LG better. You can use \n/feedback to give me your feedback\n\n\

/start_call -- to be called when you start a call on any platform (only available for admins)\n\
/end_call -- ends the call that is currently on (only available for admins)\n\
/birthdays -- shows the full list of birthdays as well as the closest birthday.\n\
/help -- can be used at any time to give the list of possible functions'
