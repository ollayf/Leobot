content, __11: The Fat Kid__
*Excerpt*

There is a fat kid in school. Every day he woke up, looked at himself in the mirror and saw that he was fat. He was ashamed of how he looked. He saw that other people were not fat, and he got really disappointed—and angry. really really angry. People started to laugh at him, whispered nasty things behind him, and everyone stopped being his friend. He was bullied for a few months straight until something happened: a kid transferred to his school. That kid was curious as to why nobody wanted to make friends with the fat kid, so he walked up to him and asked, "why don't you have friends?" The fat kid replied, "because I'm fat and everyone is not." then the new kid laughed it off as a joke and said, "what? you're not fat!" Turns out, his mirror was distorted and it made him look fat. And because it made him look fat, he thought he was fat. (I always wondered why he only looked at 1 mirror in his entire life, or never asked his parents why)

Point being: sometimes we value ourselves based on the image of ourselves. For sure, we are created in the image of God. And this adage works both ways too—regardless of our funky or quirky we look! Perhaps, someday, all we have to do is to look at the right mirror, not the one at your house, or the one that looks the smoothest. It could be, by some strange chance, that the mirror is provided by God himself. One look and you'll know that you are perfect. Not because you are, but because you are God's child. God didn't make us perfect because He couldn't. Quite the contrary! He could, yet he couldn't. If we were perfect, why is there a need for God? Neither does God need our love. But we are made complete in Christ and that's who we are.

The new kid laughed it off as a joke and said, "what? You're not fat!"
Turns out, his mirror was distorted and it made him look fat—making him think he was fat. (I always wondered why he only looked at 1 mirror in his entire life)

Sometimes we value ourselves based on our self-image. Yes, we are created in the image of God. Perhaps, someday, we just need to find the right mirror, not the one at home, or even the smoothest. It could be, by luck, that the mirror’s provided by God himself. One look and you'll know that you’re perfect. Not because you are, but because you’re God's child. God didn't make us perfect because He couldn't. Quite the contrary! We are made complete in Christ and that's who we are.

CONTENT: __16: The Fat Kid__
*Excerpt*

There’s a fat kid in school who woke up every day, looked in the mirror, and saw that he was fat. Ashamed, he was. Other people were not fat, and he got disappointed—and really angry. People laughed and whispered nasty things behind him. Everyone stopped being his friend, and was bullied until something happened: a kid transferred to his school. New kid was curious: why nobody was friends with the fat kid, so he walked up to him and asked,
"Why don't you have friends?"
“Because I'm fat and everyone is not," the fat kid replied. 
The new kid laughed it off as a joke and said, "what? You're not fat!"
Turns out, his mirror was distorted and it made him look fat—making him think he was fat. (I always wondered why he only looked at 1 mirror in his entire life)

content, __24: The Fat Kid__
*Excerpt*

There’s a fat kid in school who woke up every day, looked in the mirror, and saw that he was fat. Ashamed, he was. Other people were not fat, and he got disappointed—and really angry. People laughed and whispered nasty things behind him. Everyone stopped being his friend, and was bullied until something happened: a kid transferred to his school. New kid was curious: why nobody was friends with the fat kid, so he walked up to him and asked,
Why don't you have friends?
